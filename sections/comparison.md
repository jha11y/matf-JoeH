### Comparison with the 2015 Mobile Accessibility Working Draft Note

In this Editor's Draft, most of the existing sections have undergone significant Mobile Accessibility Task Force review and updates. The current Draft has been restructured to align with WCAG2ICT rather than continue with the structure and format of the 2015 Mobile Accessibility Mapping document.

With this perspective in mind, the following list highlights where this current document (WCAG2Mobile) differs from the 2015 Mobile Accessibility Mapping document to apply all success criteria of WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.2, and acknowledge the change to 4.1.1 Parsing to Mobile Applications:

- New Background section to explain the change in scope for the current document
- Modifications to key terms introduced by WCAG2ICT:
  - closed functionality
  - menu-driven interface
  - platform software
  - virtual keyboard
- New key terms introduced by WCAG2Mobile:
  - [note:Work In Progress]
- Inclusion of all WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA success criteria and not just those specifically affected by mobile phone usage.

The prior 2015 Mobile Working Draft Note included specific guidance on the following WCAG 2.0 success criteria for mobile, primarily for a mobile web context:

- Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) (Level AAA)
- Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)
- Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A)
- Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)
- Success Criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)
- Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 3.2.4 Consistent Identification (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
- Success Criterion 3.3.5 Help (Level AAA)

Supporting documentation in the Mobile Mapping Appendix included [WCAG 2.0 Techniques that Apply to Mobile](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/MobileTechniques/) to address mobile web use cases for the rest of the WCAG 2.0 success criterion at the Level A, AA, and AAA levels as they were available in 2015 when the webpage was published. However, most listed techniques have limited application to native mobile applications and cross-platform frameworks like Flutter and React Native.
