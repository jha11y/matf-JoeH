### Excluded from Scope

The following are out of scope for this document:

- This document does not propose changes to WCAG 2 or its supporting documents; it does not include interpretations for implementing WCAG 2 in web technologies.
- This document is not sufficient by itself to ensure accessibility in Mobile Applications. As a web standard, WCAG does not fully cover all accessibility requirements for non-user interface aspects of platforms, user-interface components as individual items, nor closed product software (where there is no Assistive Technology to communicate programmatic information).
- This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, because the basic constructs on which WCAG 2 is built do not apply to these.
- This document does not comment on WCAG Level AAA success criterion.
- This document does not provide supporting techniques for implementing WCAG 2 in Mobile Applications.
- This document is purely an informative note about Mobile Applications, not a standard, so it does not describe how Mobile Applications should conform to it.
