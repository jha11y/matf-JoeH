## Introduction
## Background 
This document is an update to a W3C First Public Working Draft, 26 February 2015, "Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile." This current document, "Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.2 to Mobile (WCAG2Mobile)" is specific to how WCAG applies to native mobile applications. 

WCAG2Mobile builds directly from the W3C supporting document, "Guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)," first made a Group Note in October 2024, describing how WCAG 2.2 could be applied to non-web documents and software. WCAG2ICT is organized to mirror WCAG's sections: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust; this model is alo used to structure WCAG2Mobile. WCAG2ICT clarifies when and how WCAG Level A and Level AA success criteria could be applied to non-web documents and software; WCAG2Mobile narrows the scope of this work to native mobile applications.
