### Background

The [Mobile Accessibility Task Force (MATF)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/task-forces/matf/) is a task force of the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/agwg/).

This document is an iteration on [Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile](https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/), published in February 2015 as [First Public Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x4-1-1-first-public-working-draft). The document was intended to become a [Group Note](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x2-5-2-group-note) but it did not move to the next maturity stage. The most recent publication was an [Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/Mobile-A11y-TF-Note/) in December 2018.

In the next years, the MATF ensured that mobile considerations were included in WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2, such as:

- 1.3.4 Orientation (AA), to support multiple display orientations;
- 1.4.10 Reflow (AA), to improve presentation on small screens;
- 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A), to provide single-pointer alternatives for touch gestures;
- 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A), to provide alternatives for device motion;
- 2.5.7 Dragging Movements (AA), to provide single-pointer alternatives for dragging;
- 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA), to providing minimum touch target sizes;
- 3.3.7 Redundant Entry (A), to reduce the amount of repetitive typing.

In January 2024, the MATF regrouped and welcomed new participants to work on updated guidance for applying WCAG 2.2 to Mobile Applications.

This current document, “Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.2 to Mobile (WCAG2Mobile)” is specific to how WCAG applies to Mobile Applications, including but not limited to native mobile apps, mobile web apps and hybrid apps using web components inside native mobile apps.

WCAG2Mobile maps directly to the W3C supporting document, “[Guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/)”, which was published as a Group Note in October 2024, describing how WCAG 2.2 could be applied to non-web documents and software. The intention of the MATF is to publish WCAG2Mobile as a Group Note, just like WCAG2ICT.

WCAG2ICT is organized to mirror the Principle, Guideline and Success Criterion structure of WCAG; this model is also used in WCAG2Mobile. WCAG2ICT clarifies when and how WCAG Level A and Level AA success criteria could be applied to non-web documents and software; WCAG2Mobile narrows the scope of this work to Mobile Applications.
