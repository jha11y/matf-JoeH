## Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control

(Level A)

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-control#intent), replacing “on a Web page” with “in a view”, “any content” with “any view”, “whole page” with “whole view”, and “on the Web page” with “in the view”; and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

**1.4.2 Audio Control:** If any audio **in a [view](#x1-2-1-page)** plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

[note:Since **any [view](#x1-2-1-page)** that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the **whole [view](#x1-2-1-page)**, all content **in the [view](#x1-2-1-page)** (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.]
