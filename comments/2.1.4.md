(Level A)

[wcag:character-key-shortcuts]
[wcag2ict:applying-sc-2-1-4-character-key-shortcuts-to-non-web-documents-and-software]

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts).

[note:The WCAG2ICT interpretation is that a long press of a key (2 seconds or more) and other accessibility features provided by the platform do not meet the WCAG definition of a keyboard shortcut. See the [keyboard shortcut](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#dfn-keyboard-shortcuts) definition for more details.]

[note:The WCAG2Mobile interpretation aligns with WCAG2ICT, emphasizing that long presses and other accessibility features are not addressed by this success criterion.]
