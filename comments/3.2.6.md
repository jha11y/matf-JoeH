## Success Criterion 3.2.6 Consistent Help

(Level A)

[wcag:consistent-help]

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.2.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help), replacing "web page(s)" and "page(s)" with "view(s)" and "CSS break-point" with "break-point".

With these substitutions, it would read:

**3.2.6 Consistent Help:** If a **[view](#x1-2-1-page)** contains any of the following help mechanisms, and those mechanisms are repeated on multiple **[views](#x1-2-1-page)** within a set of **[views](#x1-2-1-page)**, they occur in the same order relative to other **[view](#x1-2-1-page)** content, unless a change is initiated by the user:

- Human contact details;
- Human contact mechanism;
- Self-help option;
- A fully automated contact mechanism.

[note:Help mechanisms may be provided directly on the **[view](#x1-2-1-page)**, or may be provided via a direct link to a different **[view](#x1-2-1-page)** containing the information.]

[note:For this success criterion, "the same order relative to other **[view](#x1-2-1-page)** content" can be thought of as how the content is ordered when the **[view](#x1-2-1-page)** is serialized. The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across **[views](#x1-2-1-page)** for the same **[view](#x1-2-1-page)** variation (e.g., **break-point**). The user can initiate a change, such as changing the **[view](#x1-2-1-page)**'s zoom or orientation, which may trigger a different **[view](#x1-2-1-page)** variation. This criterion is concerned with relative order across **[views](#x1-2-1-page)** displayed in the same **[view](#x1-2-1-page)** variation (e.g., same zoom level and orientation).]
